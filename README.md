# Projects
Summary of all official BDU Projects, project managers, and bounty allocations. 

Official projects are currently chosen by the BDU Foundation, but soon they will be chosen by our DAO instead. Community members can suggest new projects in the discord group

Each project 
- is assigned an individual or a small team as project manager. 
- has mission and goals set by the foundation and project manager
- receives an allocation of devcash, used by the project manager to fulfill the goals & mission.
